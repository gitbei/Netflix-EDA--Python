# Netflix Dataset Analysis
This repository contains the analysis of the Netflix dataset using various Python libraries. The analysis includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), visualizations, insights, and recommendations based on the data.

## Introduction
This project aims to analyze a Netflix dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and insights. The analysis is conducted using Python and its data analysis libraries. The results are presented through visualizations and summarized with insights and actionable recommendations.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis contains information about Netflix shows and movies, including attributes such as show_id, title, date_added, release year, rating, cast, director, country, listed_in and more.


# Analysis
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA section explores the dataset to understand its structure, clean the data, and identify key features. This includes:
- Checking for missing values
- Understanding data distributions
- Identifying data types
- Exploring relationships between different variables

# Visualizations
## Various visualizations are created to illustrate the findings from the dataset. These include:

- Histograms
- Line plots
- Bar plots
- Box plots
- Heatmaps
Each visualization is accompanied by insights that explain the observed patterns.


## Insights are derived from the visualizations and EDA. These insights provide a deeper understanding of the data, such as:

Popular genres on Netflix
Trends in show and movie releases over the years
Distribution of ratings
Relationships between different attributes
Recommendations
Based on the insights, several recommendations are provided. These recommendations aim to help Netflix improve its content strategy, user engagement, and overall service.
